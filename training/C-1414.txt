I hereby certify that the information given above is true and complete to the best of my knowledge and understand that pursuant to NMOCD rules and regulations all operators are required to report and/or file certain release notifications and perform corrective actions for releases which may endanger public health or the environment.  The acceptance of a C-141 report by the NMOCD marked as "Final Report" does not relieve the operator of liability should their operations have failed to adequately investigate and remediate contamination that pose a threat to ground water, surface water, human health or the environment.  In addition, NMOCD acceptance of a C-141 report does not relieve the operator of responsibility for compliance with any other federal, state, or local laws and/or regulations.
